description = "An old scratchoff lotto ticket. Its already been scratched, unfortunately. Even more unfortunately, its not a winner. They didnâ€™t even win any of the smaller prizes, like the $2 that you would pay off the ticket. Not even worth the effort to put it in a trashcan. Well, maybe you can be a good samaritan and put it there for them."
